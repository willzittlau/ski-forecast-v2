# Ski/Weather Forecast app
**Currently under construction. For a live demo of V1, please visit https://skiforecast.herokuapp.com/**

This is a personal weather forecast app I made to streamline the process when I'm looking at which areas to ski in the winter. V2 aims to cleanup the file structure and package the api as a simple json file to keep the application light.

## Usage

Use this site as much as youd like!! :) message me if you want a specific area added.

## Limitations

This site queries SpotWX and Avalanche Canada to generate data. It may break if the structure of either of these sites changes. Currently it will only work for areas in Canada due to using Avalanche Canada avy forecast data.

## Contributing

Let me know any changes you'd want to see!
